	<h3>Request Scoped</h3> 
	<p>Run this URL in different browsers. You should see that each request (click)
	has its own version of the variable. The value is continually reset to its initial value of 0 and
	 than incremented. Use this type of scope for short term values such as a form submission. This is the 
	 default scope of a managed bean.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Counter value:</strong> #{counterRequestScoped.counterValue}</p>
	
	<h:form>
		<h:commandButton action="#{counterRequestScoped.incrementCounter()}" value="Click to increment"/>
